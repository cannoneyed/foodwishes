# ðŸŒ® Food Wishes mobile

I've been a big fan of Chef John's cooking videos on
[foodwishes.com](foodwishes.com) for a long time, and I've always wished that
his site were a bit more mobile-friendly. So I built
[foodwishes.app](foodwishes.app) to host his video recipes in a more
mobile-friendly way.

Install it and run:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Deploy

```sh
yarn deploy
```
